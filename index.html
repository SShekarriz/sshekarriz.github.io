<font size="+2">Short Bio</font>
I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the [Surette laboratory](https://www.surettelab.ca/) at McMaster University. 
My Ph.D. focuses on developing a culture-enriched metagenomic approach to study intestinal microbiota in healthy individuals 
and patients with ulcerative colitis. I am also a part-time bioinformatics consultant for [eDNAtec](https://ednatec.com/), 
an environmental genomic company located in St.John's, Canada.
