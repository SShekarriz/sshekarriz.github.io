My name is Shahrokh, aka Sharok, Shekarriz. I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Surette laboratory at McMaster University. 
My Ph.D. focused on developing a culture-enriched metagenomic approach to study intestinal microbiota in healthy individuals 
and patients with ulcerative colitis. I am also a part-time bioinformatics consultant for eDNAtec, an environmental genomic 
company located in St.John's, Canada.
