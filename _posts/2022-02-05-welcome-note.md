We often use GitHub for versions controls and to collaborate with other scientists. But one of the other advantages of GitHub is the ability to host your website for free. Github pages work by running Jekyll --- which transforms plain text into static websites--- and you can use it to host your webpage. It's fully customizable, and there are hundreds of templates to choose from for your website. If you like to know more about this, [HERE](https://jekyllrb.com/) is an excellent place to start.
