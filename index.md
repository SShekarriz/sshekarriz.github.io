## Short Bio
I am a recent Ph.D. graduate, currently a Postdoctoral fellow in the [Michael Surette](https://www.surettelab.ca/) laboratory at McMaster University. 
My Ph.D. focused on developing a culture-enriched metagenomic approach to study intestinal microbiota in healthy individuals 
and patients with ulcerative colitis. I am also a part-time bioinformatics consultant for [eDNAtec](https://ednatec.com/), 
an environmental genomic company located in St.John's, Canada.
