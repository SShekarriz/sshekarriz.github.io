Hi there! my name is Shahrokh (Sharok), I'm a graduate student, and welcome to my website :)

I've completed my undergrad in molecular biology in Tehran and came to McMaster University in September 2014 to do a Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics under the supervision of [Brian Golding](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/golding) in the department of biology. My Master thesis focused on environmental monitoring 
using eDNA. We have developed a database of bioindicator species to indetify these organisms from the bullk environmental samples in order to study the impact of anthropogenic activities. 

In December 2016, I joined [Michael Surette's](https://www.surettelab.ca/) lab as a research assistant for one year. Subsequently, I started my Ph.D. in January 2018 to pursue my interest in the human gut microbiome. In my Ph.D. dissertation, I'm working to develope a culture-enriched metagenomic (CEMG) approach to study intestinal microbiota in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis. We have shown that the CEMG approach provides a greater resolution to study more difficult microbiome related questions such as microbial engraftment after fecal microbiota transplantation. This work is currently under revision. To know more about my ongoing projects, please visit here and to see my list of publication so far, please visit this page. 

Beside my Ph.D. studies, I'm a part-time bioinformatics consultant for [eDNAtec](https://ednatec.com/) company since Jan 2019. I've developed a metagenomic pipeline for them to profile functional and taxonomic composition of deep ocean samples. I also 

If you are not interested in microbiome or environment conservation, we can still talk about craft beer and coffee ;)
