Hi there! my name is Shahrokh (Sharok), I'm a graduate student, and this is my website :)
I've completed my undergrad in molecular biology in Tehran and came to McMaster University in September 2014 to do a Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics under the supervision of [Brian Golding](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/golding) in the department of biology. My Master thesis focused on environmental monitoring 
using eDNA. We have developed a database of bioindicator species to indetify these organisms from the bullk environmental samples in order to study the impact of anthropogenic activities. 

In December 2016, I joined [Michael Surette's](https://www.surettelab.ca/) lab as a research assistant for one year. Subsequently, I started my Ph.D. in January 2018 to pursue my interest in utilizing microbiome profiling, comparative metagenomics, and culture-enriched metagenomics to investigate the human gut microbiome.
> In my Ph.D. thesis, I'm working to develope a culture-enriched metagenomic (CEMG) approach to study intestinal microbiota in healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis. We showed that the CEMG approach provides a greater resolution to study more difficult microbiome related questions such as microbial engraftment after fecal microbiota transplantation.

Beside my Ph.D. studies, I'm a
